## STM32 Bluetooth programmer using ESP32

In this project, I use a ESP32 as a Serial Bluetooth device in order to recieve the binary file wirelessly through bluetooth, and then it programs the STM32 microcontroller via UART through the System Memory boot option, which allows you to reprogram an STM32 chip through USART (and SPI on some microcontrollers.)
